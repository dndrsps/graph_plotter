    2. In the "Settings" window, write your function-of-one-variable into the "f(x)=" or "g(x)=" field.
    (Note: Phyton3 syntax are to be used, for e.g.: f(x)= x**2)
    3. Press "Draw" and your function(s) graph will be apper in the "Graph window".
    4. Graph f(x) and g(x) is drawn in red and blue, respectively.
    5. You can declare contants by filling out the "A=", "B=", "C=" and "D=" fields.
    6. You can zoom-in and out in the graph adjusting the "size" scale.
